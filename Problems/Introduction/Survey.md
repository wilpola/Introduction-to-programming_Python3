# Write a short description about yourself and about your history education:

> My name is Ville Wilpola and I am 21 years old. I have been interested in programming since I was very young and have been mainly focusing on front-end development. Thus, I have extensive knowledge about the basics of programming. During the past year, I have been learning about becoming a full-stack developer and learned about backend development (node.js). In the past, I have worked on some simple data-science problems with Python 3 and some of its powerful libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, and MatPlotlib to name a few. I am not familiar with Py2 syntax and the differences between Py2 and Py3.

## Which of the floowing learning methods suits your learning the best (pick one):

Independet learning

## Any comment or question so far?

> For the above question, I answered independent learning because it is imperative that I get some hands-on practice with the problem to fully understand the concept. If I don't understand something I usually default to reading the documentation to get a very detailed explanation for a specific issue.
