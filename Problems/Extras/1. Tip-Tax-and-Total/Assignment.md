# Tip, Tax, and Total

Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The
program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount
of a 15 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total.

## Logic

1. Ask the user to enter the total price before tax.
2. Run the tip function that will output 0.15(initial)
3. Run the tax function that will output 0.07(initial)
4. Run a function that will return a total -> initial + tip + tax = total
