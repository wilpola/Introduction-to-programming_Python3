# Introduction-to-programming_Python3

This is a repository for my introduction to programming course

To find all the exercises, browse into the extras folder, and in there select the assignment you are looking for.
Each assignment contains at least 2 files. One is a .md file that has the assignment info, and the other is the python code.

## How to use the repository

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Go into the file location and find the assignment you are looking for
